Mix well, breaking up any clumps with the back of your spoon. 2)  Add 1/2 teaspoon white vinegar and 1 tablespoon hydrogen peroxide (3% kind) to a small spray bottle.  Slowly spray vinegar/hydrogen peroxide onto dry mixture.  You may not need to use all the vinegar/hydrogen peroxide.  Youâ€™ve added enough when it feels like slightly damp (not wet) sand.  It should clump together when you squeeze it into a ball, but it should also break apart easily when you drop it into the bowl. (see step 5 above for more details).3)  Scoop fizzy mixture into silicone ice cube tray and press firmly into each opening.  One batch should yield about 10-12 toilet cleaning fizzies.  Let dry overnight (or up to 2-3 days, depending on the humidity in your home).  Make sure completely dry before attempting to remove them from mold. 4)  Store in an airtight plastic container (PET plastic #1 or HDPE plastic #2).
